# Terraform Test Module

This repository contains a simple Terraform module created specifically for a **test assignment**.  

## Overview

- **AWS Stub**  
  The AWS configuration in this module is just a stub.  
  It does not create or manage any actual AWS resources.  

- **State Storage**  
  Terraform state is stored directly in this repository, purely for simplicity, so thereâ€™s no need to configure an S3 bucket and pay for it.
